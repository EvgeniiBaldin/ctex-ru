  The book "Computer Typesetting Using LaTeX" was published by the
  "BHV-Petersburg" (Russia) publishing house in 2008 under ISBN
  978-5-9775-0230-6.  Under the contract with the publishing house, I
  have now regained exclusive rights to the content and decided to

  This book is a guide to using the LaTeX document preparation
  system. It describes the complete fundamentals of the typesetting
  and layout processes and covers at least 1300 LaTeX commands and
  about 750 packages, styles, and classes that can be used in the
  typesetting of any documents.  It also deals with creating
  presentations, table layouts, inserting graphics, bibliography and
  index, and many other tasks. Specific examples demonstrate that
  publishing systems using LaTeX can handle projects of any scope and
  complexity. A major part of the book is devoted to the typesetting
  of mathematical text, which is the key differentiator of LaTeX
  compared to other word processors.

  The book was written completely and exclusively by means of LaTeX
  tools.  As the author of both the content and the typesetting, I
  will greatly appreciate any comments and useful advice on improving
  the quality of the electronic version of the book.
